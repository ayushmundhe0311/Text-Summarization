# **Text Summarization App Using T5 and Streamlit**

This project is a web-based application for summarizing text using the pre-trained **T5 Transformer model** from Hugging Face. The app is built with **Streamlit**, providing an interactive user interface for easy text input, adjustable parameters, and summary generation.

---

## **Features**
- Input any text to generate a concise summary.
- Adjust parameters to customize summarization:
  - **Maximum Summary Length**: Control the length of the summary.
  - **Beam Search**: Enhance summary quality by exploring multiple generation paths.
  - **Length Penalty**: Fine-tune the balance between brevity and detail in the summary.
- Download the generated summary as a text file.
